# Overview

The purpose of this program is to expand my knowledge on SQLite and Python. I wanted to learn more about relational databases and how to use them. There is still more that needs to be learned and I plan to do more research on this topic in the future.

This program will create a table within a database called characters, which is populated by characters from the show Naruto. This table has 4 columns, the ID#, Name, Age, and Rank. All of the functionality of the program is done by these columns and you can add, remove, update, and display certain characters.

A demonstration of the program is below.

# Relational Database

The database I am using is called characters.db and is a database that holds the tables.

There is currently one table within the database name characters which is just a basic table containing characters, name, age, and rank.

# Development Environment

This program was created using Python and SQLite

# Future Work

* Create more tables that go into more depth of the characters attributes.
* Make the program more readable by fixing and improving UI elements.
